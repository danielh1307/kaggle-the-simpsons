Komplexere Modell-Architektur
=============================

More Convolutional Layers: You can add more convolutional layers with increasing numbers of filters to capture more complex features.

Batch Normalization: Adding batch normalization after each convolutional layer can stabilize training.

Additional Fully Connected Layers: You can add more fully connected layers, but remember to use dropout or other regularization techniques.

Global Average Pooling: Before the fully connected layers, you can add a Global Average Pooling layer to reduce dimensions and computational cost.

To prevent overfitting, you can employ several strategies:

Data Augmentation: Increase the diversity of your training set by applying random transformations like rotation, flipping, and scaling.

Dropout: You're already using dropout in your model, which is good. You can experiment with different dropout rates.

Regularization: Use L1 or L2 regularization on your model's weights.

Early Stopping: Monitor the validation loss during training and stop when it starts to increase, while the training loss is still decreasing.

Cross-Validation: Use k-fold cross-validation to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

Reduce Model Complexity: If your model is very deep, consider making it shallower or reducing the number of neurons in the fully connected layers.

Use a Learning Rate Schedule: Decrease the learning rate during training.

Batch Normalization: You can add batch normalization layers, as they can also act as a form of regularization.

Use Pretrained Models: Fine-tune a pre-trained model on your specific task. Pre-trained models usually generalize well if the original task is similar to your task.

Ensemble Methods: Use an ensemble of models to make predictions, which often improves generalization.

Monitor Metrics: Keep an eye on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a validation set, not just the training set.

Pruning: Remove neurons or even layers that do not contribute much to the model's performance.

L2-Regularization
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, weight_decay=0.01)

L1-Regularization
For L1 regularization, you'll need to manually add it to your loss. Here's an example:
l1_lambda = 0.01  # Regularization rate for L1

# Calculate the regularized loss
l1_norm = sum(p.abs().sum() for p in model.parameters())
loss = criterion(output, target) + l1_lambda * l1_norm

# Backpropagation and optimization
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
